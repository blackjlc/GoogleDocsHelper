# GoogleDocsHelper
A google docs toolbox that help me do weird stuff to my Google documents.

## CreateBookmarksAndLinksBodyToThem
It would add bookmarks to all the headings in your document and searches through the body to find text that are the same as the heading and links them to the headings.
### How to use
1. Open your Google document
2. Find Custom tools on the menu
3. Click "Add links to all keywords in the document"
### Beware
It would destroy all your existing bookmarks when you run it. Comment the code under "Clear all bookmarks" if you don't want that to happen.
